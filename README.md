# Memory Master

https://ngvuong.github.io/Memory-Card/

A simple game to test your memory using country flags and names. Click on all the flags without clicking twice on any one of them. Each level will get progressively more difficult with additional flags added.

## Technologies and key concepts

In order to further practice using React, this project was initialized with create-react-app. The main focus includes working with functional components and the hook system. Common hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useRef were used to keep track of user clicking on each card as well as scores and levels.
